Sergey was an intravert for the majority of his life. He turned 40 last year (omg, that number sounds weird somehow) and he has many questions about his life which he can't answer.

He tried many things, he failed many times, but he seemed to find solutions for most of the situations until he didn't. 

He now faces a strong dilemma what to do about his remaining life.
